I created this project to demonstration the following:
1) Developing a class, methods, etc. using the Groovy programming language
2) Creating unit tests (TDD) using TestNG
3) Creating a dev pipeline within GitHub
4) Implementing a continuous testing process workflow using GitHub actions
   
Future Plans:
1) Implement continuous performance testing
2) Implement continuous integration testing
3) Implement continuous UAT testing
4) Implement continuous smoke testing
